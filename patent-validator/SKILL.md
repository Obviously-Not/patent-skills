# Patent Validator

Generate comprehensive search strategies for distinctive patterns identified by patent-scanner. This skill helps you research existing implementations - it does NOT perform searches or provide conclusions.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks to:
- "Help me search for similar implementations"
- "Generate search queries for my concept"
- "What should I search for?"
- "Validate my patent-scanner findings"
- "Create a research strategy"

## Important Limitations

- Generates search queries only - does NOT perform searches
- Cannot assess uniqueness or patentability
- Cannot replace professional patent search
- Provides tools for research, not conclusions

---

## Process Flow

```
1. INPUT: Receive patent-scanner findings
   - patterns.json from patent-scanner
   - Or manual pattern description
   - VALIDATE: Check input structure

2. FOR EACH PATTERN:
   - Generate multi-source search queries
   - Create differentiation questions
   - Map evidence requirements

3. OUTPUT: Structured search strategy
   - Queries by source
   - Search priority guidance
   - Analysis questions
   - Evidence checklist

ERROR HANDLING:
- Empty input: "No patterns found. Run patent-scanner first."
- Invalid format: "Unable to parse. Describe your pattern manually."
- Missing fields: Skip pattern, report "Pattern [X] skipped - missing [field]"
- All patterns below threshold: "No patterns above score threshold (>=5)"
```

---

## Input Options

### Option 1: From patent-scanner Output

```
I have patent-scanner results to validate:
[paste patterns.json or summary]
```

### Option 2: Manual Description

```
Validate this concept:
- Pattern: [title]
- Components: [what's combined]
- Problem solved: [description]
- Claimed benefit: [what makes it different]
```

---

## Search Strategy Generation

### 1. Multi-Source Query Generation

For each pattern, generate queries for:

| Source | Query Type | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Google Patents | Boolean combinations | Patent landscape |
| USPTO | CPC codes + keywords | US patents |
| Google Scholar | Academic phrasing | Research papers |
| Industry Publications | Trade terminology | Market solutions |

**Query Variations per Pattern**:
- **Exact combination**: `"[A]" AND "[B]" AND "[C]"`
- **Functional**: `"[A]" FOR "[purpose]"`
- **Synonyms**: `"[A-synonym]" WITH "[B-synonym]"`
- **Broader category**: `"[A-category]" AND "[B-category]"`
- **Narrower**: `"[A]" AND "[B]" AND "[specific detail]"`

### 2. Search Priority Guidance

Prioritize sources based on pattern type:

| Pattern Type | Priority Order |
|--------------|----------------|
| Process/Method | Patents -> Publications -> Products |
| Hardware | Patents -> Products -> Publications |
| Software-adjacent | Patents -> GitHub -> Publications |
| Research/Academic | Publications -> Patents -> Products |

### 3. Differentiation Analysis Framework

Questions to guide analysis of search results:

**Technical Differentiation**:
- What's different in your approach vs. found results?
- What technical advantages does yours offer?
- What performance improvements exist?

**Problem-Solution Fit**:
- What problems does yours solve that others don't?
- Does your approach address limitations of existing solutions?
- Is the problem framing itself different?

**Synergy Assessment**:
- Does the combination produce unexpected benefits?
- Is the result greater than sum of parts (1+1=3)?
- What barriers existed before this approach?

## Next Steps (Required in All Outputs)

```markdown
---

## Immediate Actions

1. **Run generated searches** - Start with priority sources
2. **Document findings** - Track what you find systematically
3. **Analyze differences** - Use differentiation questions
4. **Consult professional** - For high-value patterns, consult patent attorney

---

## Research Documentation

For each search result relevant to your pattern:
- [ ] Note the source (patent number, paper title, product name)
- [ ] Summarize approach
- [ ] Document key differences from your approach
- [ ] Save evidence screenshots/PDFs
```

---

## Terminology Rules (MANDATORY)

### Never Use
- "patentable"
- "novel" (legal sense)
- "non-obvious"
- "prior art"
- "claims"
- "already patented"

### Always Use Instead
- "distinctive"
- "unique"
- "sophisticated"
- "existing implementations"
- "already implemented"

---

## Required Disclaimer

ALWAYS include at the end of ANY output:

> **Disclaimer**: This tool generates search strategies only. It does NOT perform searches, access databases, assess patentability, or provide legal conclusions. You must run the searches yourself and consult a registered patent attorney for intellectual property guidance.

---

## Workflow Integration

```
patent-scanner -> patterns.json -> patent-validator -> search_strategies.json
                                                    -> technical_disclosure.md
```

**Recommended Workflow**:
1. **Start**: `patent-scanner` - Analyze your concept description
2. **Then**: `patent-validator` - Generate search strategies for findings
3. **User**: Run searches, document findings
4. **Final**: Consult patent attorney with documented findings

---

## Error Handling

**No Input Provided**:
```
I need pattern details to generate search strategies. You can:
- Paste output from patent-scanner
- Describe your pattern manually (title, components, problem solved)
```

**Pattern Too Vague**:
```
The pattern description is too general to generate effective queries.
Please provide more specifics about:
- The technical mechanism
- Key components being combined
- The specific problem being solved
```
